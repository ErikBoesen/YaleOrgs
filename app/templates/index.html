<h1>API documentation</h1>
<p>The YaleOrgs API can be used to programmatically query information about the student organizations at Yale in your own programs and software projects. Data is served in a developer-friendly JSON format.
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>In order to verify your identity, you must create a token below, attaching an accurate description of what you will use it for. Then, when making HTTP queries to the API (described in detail below), you must pass in the HTTP header <code>Authorization</code>, with a value of <code>Bearer _______</code>, replacing the underscores with the key you have been provided.</p>
<div id="key">
    <table id="keys_table">
        <thead>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Created</th>
            <th>Last Used</th>
            <th>Calls</th>
            <th>Delete</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="keys_list">
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <div id="key_creator">
        <input type="text" id="description_key" placeholder="Key Description">
        <button id="get_key" disabled>Create Key</button>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>Endpoints</h3>
<p>The API has one endpoint: <code>POST https://yaleorgs.com/api/organizations</code>. The endpoint returns a JSON list of organizations.</p>
<p>It optionally accepts a JSON-formatted body containing the properties <code>filters</code>, <code>page</code>, and <code>page_size</code> (which are not required). <code>filters</code> is a dictionary mapping column names to lists of acceptable values. <code>page</code> represents the number of the page of students to get, which may allow you to improve request efficiency if you do not need to fetch every student at once. <code>page_size</code> allows you to change the size of each page you'd like, and is ignored if <code>page</code> is not provided. For example:</p>
<pre>
{
    "filters": {
        "type": ["University Life Administration"],
        "category": "Cultural",
    },
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 10
}
</pre>
<p>This payload would fetch the first page of 10 "Cultural" groups under the "University Life Administration" type. These filters can be provided as lists of acceptable values or as single values to match.</p>
<p>Properties that can be filtered by include <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>type</code>, and <code>category</code>.</p>
<h3>Models</h3>
<p>Only one model is used by the API, <code>Organization</code>. Make a request to examine its schema.</p>
